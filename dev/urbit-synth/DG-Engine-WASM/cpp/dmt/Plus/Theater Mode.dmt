This instrument can only be triggered by the plant about every 12 seconds, so if your plant isn’t putting out many notes, it may go silent. When your plant is moderately active, chimes will be added. When your plant is most active, the synthesizer will be replaced with a choir.","Overview":"Inspired by science fiction and planetarium soundtracks from the 1980s."},"MASTER_GAIN":1.0,"MASTER_REVERB_DRY":0.7741116881370544,"MASTER_REVERB_WET":1.952622413635254,"MASTER_TEMPO":28.071060180664063,"NAME":"Theater Mode","REVERB":{"BANDWIDTH":0.3,"DAMPING":0.4,"EARLY_LEVEL":29.0609130859375,"ROOM_SIZE":282.8,"SPREAD":54.23011779785156,"TAIL_LEVEL":27.62267303466797,"TIME":9.143399238586426},"TUNING":{"frequency":440.0,"root":"G","scale":"Pentatonic Minor"},"VOICES":[{"VOICE_ARP_SUBDIVISION":1.0,"VOICE_ARP_SUBDIVISION_ACTIVITY_MAP":[[63.0,1.0]],"VOICE_DELAY_DRY":1.0,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_1":0.0,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_2":0.0,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_3":0.0,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_1":2,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_2":1,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_3":3,"VOICE_DELAY_WET":0.0,"VOICE_GAIN":1.0,"VOICE_GAIN_ACTIVITY_MAP":[[63.0,1.0],[64.0,1.0],[109.0,1.0],[110.0,0.0]],"VOICE_LOWEST_NOTE":34,"VOICE_NOTE_RANGE":24,"VOICE_SAMPLE":{"extension":"wav","name":"Pad Theater","type":"embedded"},"VOICE_TRANSPOSE_POST_NOTE_MAP":0,"VOICE_TRANSPOSE_PRE_NOTE_MAP":0},{"VOICE_ARP_SUBDIVISION":8.0,"VOICE_ARP_SUBDIVISION_ACTIVITY_MAP":[[0,0.25],[15,0.25],[16,0.25],[31,0.25],[32,0.25],[47,0.25],[48,0.25],[63,0.25],[64,0.25],[79,0.25],[80,8.0],[95,8.0],[96,8.0],[111,8.0],[112,8.0],[127,8.0]],"VOICE_DELAY_DRY":0.3950931429862976,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_1":0.3787817060947418,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_2":0.16233502328395844,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_3":0.4328933656215668,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_1":2,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_2":1,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_3":3,"VOICE_DELAY_WET":0.6049068570137024,"VOICE_GAIN":0.7306337952613831,"VOICE_GAIN_ACTIVITY_MAP":[[63.0,0.0],[64.0,1.0],[109.0,1.0],[110.0,1.0]],"VOICE_LOWEST_NOTE":26,"VOICE_NOTE_RANGE":23,"VOICE_SAMPLE":{"extension":"wav","name":"Choir 1","type":"embedded"},"VOICE_TRANSPOSE_POST_NOTE_MAP":0,"VOICE_TRANSPOSE_PRE_NOTE_MAP":0},{"VOICE_ARP_SUBDIVISION":6.0,"VOICE_ARP_SUBDIVISION_ACTIVITY_MAP":[[63.0,6.0]],"VOICE_DELAY_DRY":0.1159052848815918,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_1":0.5038577914237976,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_2":0.21593907475471497,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_3":0.5758375525474548,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_1":2,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_2":1,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_3":3,"VOICE_DELAY_WET":0.8840947151184082,"VOICE_GAIN":0.14025819301605225,"VOICE_GAIN_ACTIVITY_MAP":[[63.0,0.0],[64.0,1.0],[109.0,1.0],[110.0,1.0]],"VOICE_LOWEST_NOTE":51,"VOICE_NOTE_RANGE":29,"VOICE_SAMPLE":{"extension":"wav","name":"Glassy","type":"embedded"},"VOICE_TRANSPOSE_POST_NOTE_MAP":0,"VOICE_TRANSPOSE_PRE_NOTE_MAP":0},{"VOICE_ARP_SUBDIVISION":1.0,"VOICE_ARP_SUBDIVISION_ACTIVITY_MAP":[[63.0,1.0]],"VOICE_DELAY_DRY":1.0,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_1":0.0,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_2":0.0,"VOICE_DELAY_FEEDBACK_3":0.0,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_1":2,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_2":1,"VOICE_DELAY_TIME_STEP_3":3,"VOICE_DELAY_WET":0.0,"VOICE_GAIN":0.5733568072319031,"VOICE_GAIN_ACTIVITY_MAP":[[63.0,1.0],[64.0,1.0],[109.0,1.0],[110.0,1.0]],"VOICE_LOWEST_NOTE":46,"VOICE_NOTE_RANGE":12,"VOICE_SAMPLE":{"extension":"wav","name":"Bass","type":"embedded"},"VOICE_TRANSPOSE_POST_NOTE_MAP":0,"VOICE_TRANSPOSE_PRE_NOTE_MAP":48}]}}
